**Scoring Principles:**
- Points accumulate based on evidence strength
- Total score is capped at 100
- Hard gates must pass first for A/B grade eligibility

## Bonus 1: Cleaning Equipment Focus (+30 to +90)

### ICP Rationale
Commercial cleaning equipment distributors are the **highest priority** target. They already have:
- Relevant product knowledge
- Existing customer relationships in facility management
- After-sales service infrastructure
- Natural cross-sell opportunities

### Detection Signals

| Level | Evidence | Points |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Light | Mentions cleaning equipment in passing | +30 |
| Moderate | Has dedicated cleaning equipment product category | +50 |
| Strong | Core offering, multiple cleaning equipment lines | +70 |
| Dominant | Primary business, extensive catalog, multiple brands | +90 |

### Product Keywords

**Commercial/Industrial:**
- "Gewerbliche Reinigung", "industrial cleaning"
- "Scheuersaugmaschinen" (scrubber dryers)
- "Kehrmaschinen" (sweepers)
- "Industriesauger" (industrial vacuums)
- "Reinigungsgeräte" (cleaning equipment)

**Exclusion:** Home robot vacuums, consumer cleaning products (unless ALSO has commercial line)

## Bonus 2: Competitor Footprint (+30 to +90)

### ICP Rationale
**This is the TOP signal.** Competitor distributors are the BEST prospects because they already have:
- Customer base in cleaning robotics
- Sales and deployment teams trained on robots

**Switching/adding robot brands is EASIER than selling cleaning equipment → robots for the first time.**
